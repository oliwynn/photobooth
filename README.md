### README.md for Raspberry Pi Selfie Station Project

#### Overview
This Python script is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi and utilizes its GPIO pins to create an interactive selfie station. It employs buttons and LEDs to indicate and control the process of capturing a photo. Audio feedback and countdown are provided before taking a selfie, and the photo is saved with a thumbnail version in specified directories.

#### Requirements
- **Hardware:**
  - Raspberry Pi (any model that supports GPIO)
  - GPIO Pins
  - LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow)
  - Button
  - Speakers for audio output
  - Camera module connected to the Raspberry Pi
- **Software:**
  - Raspbian OS or any compatible Linux distribution
  - Python 2.7 (Note: for Python 3.x, minor adjustments might be needed)
  - Python Libraries: `RPi.GPIO`, `os`, `time`, `PIL` (or `Pillow` for Python Imaging Library functions)

#### Setup and Installation
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the LEDs to GPIO pins 24 (red), 25 (green), and 27 (yellow).
   - Connect a button to GPIO pin 23.
   - Ensure the camera module is properly installed and enabled.
   - Connect speakers to the Raspberry Pi audio jack.

2. **Software Installation:**
   - Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install python-pil python-rpi.gpio
     ```
   - Clone or download this script into your Raspberry Pi.

3. **Running the Script:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Run the script using:
     ```bash
     sudo python selfie_station.py
     ```

#### Operation
- **Usage:**
  - Press the connected button to initiate the selfie process.
  - The script will give a countdown with visual (LEDs) and audio signals before taking a photo.
  - Photos are saved in the `SelfieStation` directory with their timestamps as filenames. Thumbnails are saved in the `SelfieStationThumb` directory.

- **LED Indicators:**
  - **Red LED (Pin 24):** On during standby and blinks during countdown.
  - **Yellow LED (Pin 27):** On during the countdown.
  - **Green LED (Pin 25):** On while the button is pressed.
  - **Flash (Pin 22):** Mimics the flash of a camera when a photo is being taken.

#### Customization
You can modify the script to adjust the timing, control additional hardware components, or integrate more complex functionalities as per your project requirements.

#### Troubleshooting
- Ensure all hardware components are properly connected and the GPIO pins are correctly designated in the script.
- Check the camera and audio output configurations if the script fails to capture photos or play sounds.

### Note
This script is designed for educational and experimental purposes. Please ensure safe and responsible usage of electronic components and Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
